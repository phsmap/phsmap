<h2>(1) Emergency Information Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This map may not be up to date or reflect real-world circumstances (i.e. blocked evacuation routes, missing/broken emergency equipment). 
This map should not be relied upon as a sole source of emergency information. 
You should always follow the directions of staff during an emergency, and take the time to familiarize yourself with your surroundings before one.</p>

<h2>(2) MCPS Sensitive Information Notice</h2>
<p>
	<li>According to MCPS policies, any map or document that provides information about the inside of MCPS 
	facilities cannot be accessible to the general public or disseminated to anyone outside of MCPS. 
	As a result, the school has requested that I implement an access control that only grants website access to MCPS students/staff + authorized visitors.</li>
	<br>
	<li>This also means that should you decide to make any "export" of this application's data (i.e. by taking screenshots or printing the map out), 
	you may not share it with anyone except for other Poolesville students, staff and temporary authorized visitors (such as students visiting our school for an event, parents, and subs).</li>

<h2>(3) Use of Account Information + Data Security Notice</h2>
<p>
	<b><u>Use of Account Information</b></u>
	<li>The resource server (which is responsible for serving map/layer data to users) controls access by looking up incoming users' Microsoft profiles and checking to make sure that they are of MCPS origin.</li>
	<br>
	<li>During this process, the server is <b>ABLE TO SEE</b> a limited amount of account data, such as email address, phone number, office location, job title and language preference. However, <b>most of it is not recorded</b> since it isn't actually used to authenticate users. (For more information about what information is visible when you log in with Microsoft see, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http">this article</a>).</li>
	<br>
	<li>The server will <b>RECORD</b> IP addresses, user names, user agents, email addresses, date/time of first and subsequent sign ins, and date/time of requests for protected resources.</li>
	<br>
	<b><u>Data Security</b></u>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>I would like to restate that this app <b>DOES NOT HANDLE any user passwords or secrets</b>, and that it <b>CANNOT ACCESS OR ACT ON BEHALF OF YOUR ACCOUNT</b>. </li>
	<br>
	<li>Users enter their passwords on Microsoft's website, after which Microsoft gives us an <i>access token</i>, which is essentially a digitally signed, temporary certificate that can be used to prove a user's identity and allow the bearer (in this case, the PHS Interactive Map) <b>limited</b> access to account information.</li>
	<br>
	<li>This is different from some other applications, where your username/password is saved by the application and then later used to act directly on your behalf -- which is bad because a password carries full account access priviledges, does not expire and can be changed to lock the original account owner out.</li>
	<br>
	<li>For more information on how this system works and how it prevents 3rd party applications such as this one from accessing your password and your account, see <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/auth-oauth2'>this document about OAuth2.0</a>.</b></li>
