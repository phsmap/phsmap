<h2>(1) Emergency Information Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This map may not be up to date or reflect real-world circumstances (i.e. blocked evacuation routes, missing/broken emergency equipment). 
This map should not be relied upon as a sole source of emergency information. 
You should always follow the directions of staff during an emergency, and take the time to familiarize yourself with your surroundings before one.</p>

<h2>(2) MCPS Sensitive Information Notice</h2>
<p>
	<li>Per MCPS policies, any map or document that provides information about the inside of MCPS 
	facilities <b>CANNOT BE ACCESSIBLE</b> to the general public or disseminated to anyone outside of MCPS. 
	As a result, all website users must sign with their mcpsmd.org accounts to be allowed access to map and facility data.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Furthermore, should you decide to make any "export" of this application's data (i.e. by taking screenshots or printing the map out), 
	you <b>MAY NOT DISSEMINATE IT</b> to anyone except for other Poolesville students, staff and temporary authorized visitors (i.e. students 
	entering for an athletic event or substitute teachers).</li>
	<br>
	<li>Please understand that this policy is in place to <b>keep our schools and other facilities safe</b>.</li>
	<br>
	<li>This policy is <b>strictly enforced</b>,
	both for us as the programmers and you as the end users.</li>

<h2>(3) Use of Account Data Notice</h2>
<p>
	<li>As a part of complying with MCPS' policies on interior maps/other similar documents, this application requires you to sign in with your MCPS issued Microsoft account
	before you can interact with any map data.</li>
	<br>
	<li>After you sign into your Microsoft account, a unique access token issued by Microsoft is saved your browser's local storage. 
	When you want to access restricted information (such as layer data for a particular map), your browser will send this token and a request for data
	to our backend server; which will then look up the information 
	for the Microsoft user that the token was issued on behalf of and use that information to make the decision to accept or reject the request for data.</li>
	<br>
	<li>In this process, our backend server is able to see information such as your name, email address, phone number (if there is one attached to your account), 
	job title, and office/workplace location. However, none of this information is ever recorded, logged or made public by our backend (although Google Firebase does record your email address the first time you sign in). *
	<br><br>
	<li>Furthermore, your token does not carry any permissions (as in, it cannot be used to act on the user's behalf nor can it be used to access/modify sensitive information). 
	Your token also loses its validity after a set amount of time (usually a couple hours at most), which is why you may have to sign back in multiple times in one day. **</li>
	<br>
	<li>We do use Google Firebase, Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) and the Microsoft Graph API to manage our sign in process.</li>
	<br>
	<li>This information was last updated on the 25th of March, 2024. This information is subject to change at any time without prior notification.</li>
	<br>
	<p><i>*: This is the information exposed by the /v1.0/me endpoint on the Microsoft Graph API.<br>
	**: All of the tokens we get issued have no OAuth scopes except for the default User.Read, which is given to all users.</p></i>
